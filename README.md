# Q-SYS UCI Plus Module

The goal with this module was to take the simplicity of UCI Layer Controller logic in the schematic editor, and bring it
into Lua, so you can make UCI Scripts for complex UCIs without the scripting getting too complex. Check out the included
file for a thorough example. This also includes a function to get the page and layer structure of any UCI as a Lua
table, and it includes the standard Uci library for completeness.
